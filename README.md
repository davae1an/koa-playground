Learning Koa2 js the MVC approach

Let’s see what files and folders there are at the root of our project with a brief explanation of what each of them is about:

controllers/ – defines your app routes and their logic
helpers/ – code and functionality to be shared by different parts of the project
middlewares/ – Express middlewares which process the incoming requests before handling them down to the routes
models/ – represents data, implements business logic and handles storage
public/ – contains all static files like images, styles and javascript
views/ – provides templates which are rendered and served by your routes
tests/ – tests everything which is in the other folders
app.js – initializes the app and glues everything together
package.json – remembers all packages that your app depends on and their versions
